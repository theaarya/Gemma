Welcome to **Gemma v2** – the next-generation version of our AI-powered diamond assistant. This branch brings major improvements including enhanced search capabilities, multimedia support, and a refined user interface. Please note that **Gemma v2** is designed to work with a local Solr instance (`diamond_core`) and requires additional setup steps compared to the main branch. It is not a quick clone-and-run version from GitHub.

- **Diamond Data & Multimedia:**  
  Prepare your diamond dataset along with associated images, videos, and PDFs. The v2 branch expects these multimedia files to be available locally (or via designated URLs).

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Gemma.git
   cd Gemma
   git checkout v2
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   ```sh

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   SOLR_COLLECTION_NAME=diamond_core
   ```

5. **Update Solr with Diamond Data:**
